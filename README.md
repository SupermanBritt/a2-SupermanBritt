This project shows a webpage that includes all of the assignment requirements and some of the optional achievements.

## Homework List
My project allows the user to track their homework by filling in assignment details and how many days are left which are then displayed in a table along with the due date which is derived based off of how many days are left and the current date. For the CSS positioning I used flexbox with it having all of the body elements positioned in a column flex-direction. To use the application fill in the text boxes and click submit to add a new assignment or delete to delete the last assignment.

## Technical Achievements
- **Created a Single-Page App**: All the sever data is shown below the HTML form and it auto updates with the curent data and the derived field from the server. The data is still displayed when refreshing the page as well as long as the server has not been restarted.

### Design Achievements
- **Had my Site Tested by Another Student**:
1. 
2. What problems did the user have with your design?
3. What comments did they make that surprised you?
4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
